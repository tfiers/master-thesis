\subsection{Selecting channels}

Many CA1 LFP recordings are not made with multichannel probes, but rather with one or more tetrodes. It is therefore relevant to ask how GEVec-based detectors perform on these types of recordings. We can approximate this setting with our current multichannel probe recording, by only using one or a few channels.

Each such selection of input channels, in combination with a certain number of delays, yields a different GEVec-based SWR detector. We evaluate and compare these detectors using the test data set, analyzing both accuracy (\cref{fig:PR-searchgrid}) and latency (\cref{fig:Latency-searchgrid}).

Active input channels are marked in solid black on a schematic of the probe tip. (Height of schematic: 687 \si{\micro\metre}). The percentage and background color of each panel indicate the maximum $F_1$ value obtained for that GEVec-based SWR detector. Each panel includes the same baseline from the state-of-the-art SWR detector, in gray.}

\end{figure}


We note some general trends. Using no extra delays results in low accuracy detectors, no matter which channels are included (top row of \cref{fig:PR-searchgrid}). For most input channel combinations, the tradeoff in number of delays observed in the previous section is preserved: using more delays increases accuracy (up to a certain point), while also increasing detection latency.

The weight visualizations of \cref{fig:LSM-comp} show a relatively high weight for the stratum radiatum / sharp wave channels. Using only one such channel as input results in low accuracy detectors however, no matter how many delays are used (second column of \cref{fig:PR-searchgrid,fig:Latency-searchgrid}). Using four such channels (second to last column) results in detectors with an accuracy approaching, but not reaching, that of the state-of-the art ripple-based detector when a sufficient number of delays is used. Interestingly, this decent accuracy is reached despite none of these four channels (numbers 2 to 5) displaying any noticeable ripple activity (\panelref{fig:LSM-comp}{A}).

Conversely, using one channel from the pyramidal cell layer (where ripples are observed) yields GEVec-based detectors on par with those that use all channels as input, both regarding accuracy and latency (third and first column of \cref{fig:PR-searchgrid,fig:Latency-searchgrid}).

This one channel GEVec-based detector thus also outperforms the ``state-of-the-art'' detector based on a band-pass filter. This state-of-the-art detector also uses only one channel as input, and is also a linear filter. This suggests that either 1) finding linear filter weights through `machine learning' (the GEVec technique) yields better results than manual filter design; or 2) that the band-pass filter used as ``state-of-the-art'' detector was not designed optimally in the first place.

Adding a stratum radiatum / sharp wave channel to the single pyramidal cell layer channel (fourth column of \cref{fig:PR-searchgrid,fig:Latency-searchgrid}), or using a cluster of channels in the pyramidal cell layer (last column) does not improve performance over the one channel case.
