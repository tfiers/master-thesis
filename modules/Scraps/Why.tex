{The importance of sharp wave-ripples}
{and of detecting them in real-time}


% WHY disrupt them
% - (Via: why detect them in real-time > to disrupt them)
% - To understand the brain \& because we have reasons to suspect them
% - 1) Past such experiments have yielded insights
% - 2) Questions left to ask about ripples
%      (and this technique could help answer)
%     - [Because they seem important]
%       i.e. why are ripples suspect

The cut is made approximately at the level of the anterior part of the ears
($\approx$ \SI{3}{\cm} posterior to the anterior commisure).

The atlas \cite{Mai2015} was used as a guide while marking the locations of
different brain areas.}
