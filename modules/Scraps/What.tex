\label{ch:SWR}


The ``sharp wave-ripple'' (SWR) is a pattern observed in voltage recordings of the mammalian brain.

This chapter zooms in on this description of SWRs. The first section describes how such voltage recordings are made, and what the origin is of the voltage signal. Next, we describe where exactly sharp wave-ripples can be observed, and what they look like. Finally, we survey the biophysical origin of sharp-wave ripples.
