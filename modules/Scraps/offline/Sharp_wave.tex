\section{Sharp waves}


Paraphrasing from \citefull{Buzsaki2015}: ``Sharp waves are large amplitude, negative polarity deflections (\SIrange{40}{100}{\ms}) in CA1 stratum radiatum. They are most often, but not always, associated with ripples in the pyramidal layer. In the alert but still animal,\footnotemark{} sharp waves are the only large-amplitude event [in the hippocampus].''

\footnotetext{Meaning not sleeping, but also not walking around, sniffing or standing up (``rearing'').}

When we imagine the sharp wave to be half a phase of a sinusoidal oscillation, its duration of \range{40}{100}{\ms} would correspond to an oscillation of \range{12.5}{5}{\Hz}.
