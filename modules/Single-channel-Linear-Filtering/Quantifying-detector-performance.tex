\sectionp{4p}{Quantifying detector performance}
\label{sec:eval}

We often want to summarize the accuracy of a detector in a single number. We choose the maximum $F_1$-score of the detector as this number. As the harmonic mean of precision and recall, it has a relatively straightforward interpretation, especially in the common case when the PR-curve is concave: the maximum $F_1$-score is then the point where precision equals recall.

For example, an SWR detector with a $\max F_1$-score of 93\% detects 93\% of all reference SWR segments, while 93\% of its detections are correct (i.e. 7\% of its detections are false positives).
