\section{Limitations of this work}
\label{sec:limits}

A major difficulty when assessing online SWR detection performance is the lack of a ground truth for what are and what are not sharp wave-ripple events. We used an offline, ripple-only detection procedure in this thesis to define reference SWR events -- as is customary in the literature.

This then explains why the online algorithms that mimic the offline band-pass filter have such good accuracy; while the algorithms that seem to detect the spatial signature of SWR's (such as the no-delay GEVec-based filter, or the multichannel recurrent neural networks), but not necessarily the ripple, yield more false positive detections.

A more minor point is that only one dataset was analyzed in this thesis -- of one recording, in $N = 1$ rat, and using one specific electrode configuration and recording location. Additionally, few graphs and results included uncertainty estimates.
