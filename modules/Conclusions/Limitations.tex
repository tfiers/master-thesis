\section{Limitations of this work}

A major difficulty when assessing online SWR detection performance is the lack of a ground truth for what are and what are not sharp wave-ripple events. We used an offline ripple-only detection procedure in this thesis to define reference SWR events -- as is customary in the literature.

It is then not surprising 

A more minor point is that only one dataset was analyzed in this thesis -- of one recording, of $N = 1$ rat, and one specific probe configuration and recording location.
