\chapter{Conclusions \& discussion}
\label{ch:conclusions}

Recall the problem statement from the introduction: Can we find an algorithm that detects sharp wave-ripples with less latency than the existing online algorithms, while being at least equally sensitive and precise? And, prompted by the development of neural probes: Are spatially distributed multichannel recordings advantageous for this task?

For the two new SWR detection algorithms that we investigated, the answer to both questions seems mostly negative -- with an important caveat however, as is discussed in \cref{sec:limits}.
