\section{Summary of findings}

% Using more than one electrode for detection (such as a stratum radiatum electrode in addition to the stratum pyramidale electrode, or multiple stratum pyramidale electrodes) does not significantly improve accuracy nor latency.

% Around 10 delays (~10 ms) is best for GEVec (both single and multichannel)

% continue: create figure with best online-BPF and best GEVec
% for best GEVec: just choose one, they're equal I guess.
% Either: all electrodes, 10 delays.
% Or: one electrode, 10 delays.
