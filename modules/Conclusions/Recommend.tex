\section{Recommendations for experimenters}
\label{sec:recommend}

We still recommend using a band-pass filter for online SWR detection -- as long as the experimenter is fine with only detecting events with a strong ripple oscillation, and not necessarily any sharp-wave.

From \cref{ch:BPF} though, it is clear that the type of band-pass filter ought to be carefully chosen. The short duration of SWR's makes it is easy to design a filter that introduces a relatively high delay (see e.g. the default ripple filter in the closed-loop neuroscience software \emph{Falcon}; \cref{fig:BPF-performance}). We find that low group-delay is a more important design consideration than sharp passband edges when designing a band-pass filter for online SWR detection. A concrete digital filter that has been shown to work well (at least at a sampling frequency of $f_s = 1000$ Hz), is a combination of an 8th order Butterworth high-pass filter, and a 2nd order Butterworth low-pass filter.
