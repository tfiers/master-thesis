\section{Directions for further work}

Given the connection between SWR's and replay (\cref{ch:science}), it might be interesting to try to decode the neural spiking activity during the events with all characteristics of an SWR, but without a strong ripple oscillation, as detected by for example the RNN or the no-delay GEVec-based filter. It might turn out that these events are also worthwile to detect in real-time.

On a related note, a stronger data labelling would be very useful to evaluate online SWR detection algorithms; maybe based on the consensus of multiple human labellers, in addition to for example spike content.

Finally, more data (from more animals, electrode configurations, and recording locations), in addition to an uncertainty estimation technique such as the bootstrap, would render the found results more robust.
