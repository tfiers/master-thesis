\chapter{Sharp wave-ripples}
\label{ch:SWR}

The sharp wave-ripple (SWR) is a well-known motif of the local field potential. \Cref{sec:anatomy} shows where SWR's are found in the brain and what they look like. \Cref{sec:recording} shows how they can be recorded, while \cref{sec:physiology} briefly describes the physiology of SWR's and how they are generated. Finally, \cref{sec:science} explains why SWR's are worth investigating in the first place.
