\chapter{Sharp wave-ripples}
\label{ch:SWR}

The sharp wave-ripple (SWR) is a well-known motif of the local field potential. \Cref{sec:anatomy} shows where SWR's are found in the brain and what they look like, while \cref{sec:physiology} briefly describes their physiology and how they are generated. \Cref{sec:recording} shows how SWR's can be recorded, and describes the data set analyzed in this thesis. The next chapter explains why SWR's are worth investigating in the first place.
