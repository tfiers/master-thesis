\label{sec:BCI}

This thesis discusses software for a brain-computer interface (BCI).\footnote{A BCI is a device that reads out brain activity, which is used to control some action. The brain receives feedback about the performed action, either through normal sensory input, or through direct neural stimulation.}
Most BCI research is focused on restoring or partially replacing a damaged nervous system after a stroke or a traumatic injury \cite{Krucoff2016}.
