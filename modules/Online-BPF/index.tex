\chapterp{3p}{Current online SWR detectors}\label{ch:BPF}

This chapter discusses the current state-of-the-art method in online SWR detection. This method is very similar to the procedure for offline ripple detection described in \cref{ch:offline}: a single recording channel that contains ripples is selected; it is band-pass filtered through the ripple band; and apply a detection threshold is applied to the envelope of the filter output.
% todo: multi-channel (Dutta, Ciliberti)

The difference is that the SWR detection must now happen under real-time constraints. No future samples can be used when deciding whether the current recording sample belongs to an SWR event. This means that the used band-pass filter (and in some studies, also the envelope estimation method) must necessarily introduce latency.

We first discuss the performance of the online band-pass filters used in the literature, and then shortly discuss online estimation of the filter output envelope.

% Goal of this chapter:
%  - Establish baseline, implement SOTA
%  - Find best digital online BPF.



% \section{Online band-pass filters}
\section{Replicating existing filters}

We selected three previously used online ripple filters and analyzed their performance. The first two filters are described in the literature. (We gathered a representative sample of original research papers that use online ripple detection -- see \cref{apx:online-detection-algos}. Most of these papers do not provide sufficient information to replicate the used filter. The two selected filters are from the two papers that did provide sufficient information.)
The third analyzed filter is the default online ripple filter in \emph{Falcon}. (\emph{`Falcon'} is an open-source software package for closed-loop neuroscience, developed and used in the Kloosterman lab, and described in \citefull{Ciliberti2017}).

The original analyzed filters use different passbands and sampling frequencies. When we `replicate' the original filters to apply them to our data, we use a standardized sampling frequency $f_s$ of 1000 Hz. When designing the replica filters, we try to match the gain- and group delay-profiles of the original filters.


\subsection{\authoryear{Ego-Stengel2009}}

In one of the first ripple disruption studies \cite{Ego-Stengel2009}, an analog band-pass filter is used. An 8th-order Butterworth high-pass filter at 100 Hz is combined with an 8th-order Butterworth low-pass filter at 400 Hz.
We approximate this continuous-time filter by the product of two discrete-time Butterworth filters at $f_s = 1000$ Hz: an 8th-order high-pass filter at 100 Hz, and a 2nd-order low-pass filter at 400 Hz.\footnotemark{} Its frequency response is compared with that of the original filter in \cref{fig:ego-stengel}.

\footnotetext{Note that we do not choose the literal discretization of the continuous-time filter (namely the combination of an 8th-order high-pass and an 8th-order low-pass Butterworth filter, discretized using e.g. the zero-order-hold method or Tustin's bilinear transform). Around 400 Hz, this discretization has too high a peak in group delay and too steep a loss in gain for its frequency response profiles to match the original filter well.}

This method is also used for subsequent group delay plots.}

\subsection{\authoryear{Dutta2018}}

In this recent analysis of an online ripple detection system \cite{Dutta2018}, a 30-tap FIR filter at $f_s = 3000$ Hz is used. In the open source code of this study\footnote{\url{https://github.com/shayokdutta/RippleDetectionAnalysis/blob/master/DataAnalysisScripts/ripple_filtering.py}}, we find that the filter is designed using the windowed-sinc method, with a Hamming window. We approximate this filter at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz with an 11-tap FIR filter, designed using the same method, window type, and passband. The correspondence is good (see \cref{fig:dutta}). Note the low attenuation outside the passband, and the constant, relatively low group-delay.

\subsection{Falcon (\authoryear{Ciliberti2017})}

The default ripple filter in \emph{Falcon} is a Type II Chebyshev filter, with a passband of $\approx$~130--283 Hz, edge widths of $\approx$~10 Hz, a minimum attenuation in the stopbands of 40 dB, and a maximum attenuation in the passband of 1 dB. The original filter operates on data with a sampling rate of 32 kHz. We can closely approximate this filter at $f_s = 1000$ Hz using a 10th-order (21-taps) Type II Chebyshev filter, with the same design parameters. Its frequency response is shown in \cref{fig:falcon}. Note the trade-off between filter quality and group delay apparent in these and the previous plots: sharp passband edges correspond to high group delays, and vice-versa.

\section{SWR detection performance}

Applying these ripple filters at $f_s = $ 1000 Hz to our recording yields online envelopes as in \cref{fig:BPF-outputs}. Quantifying detection performance as described in \cref{ch:eval}, and using the entire evaluation data set and for a range of different thresholds, results in the $PR$- and latency curves of \cref{fig:BPF-performance}.

Each threshold setting for a ripple filter corresponds to a point on the precision-recall curve in the bottom-left panel, and to a distribution of relative detection latencies. The median and interquartile range of this distribution are plotted in the top-left or bottom-right panel (as a point of the bold curve, and a slice of the shaded band, respectively).\newline
These latency distribution plots are divided over two panels so that their entire range can be clearly visualized, both for the low recall -- high precision regime as for the high recall -- low precision regime. The cutoff is made at the $\max{F_1}$ point, marked with shaded black circles.}
\label{fig:BPF-performance}
\end{figure}

We notice the relatively low recall and precision of the default ripple filter in \emph{Falcon}. This is due to the presence of sharp wave-ripple events with ripple frequency < 130 Hz in our dataset (as described earlier and as confirmed by the manual labelling effort by neuroscientists). The default \emph{Falcon} online ripple filter has a left passband edge of $\pm$ 130 Hz, and therefore does not detect these ripples.\footnote{When we design a new band-pass filter based on the default \emph{Falcon} filter (same design characteristics) but with a passband $\approx$ 100--200 Hz, we obtain a marked improvement in detection accuracy. The $PR$-curve (not shown) then resembles that of the Dutta et al filter. Detection latency increases even further though.}

We design an online ripple filter (at $f_s = $ 1000 Hz) with equal or better detection performance than the analyzed ripple filters. This filter is labelled ``Proposed online BPF'' in \cref{fig:BPF-outputs,fig:BPF-performance}, and is based on our replica of the Ego-Stengel et al filter. It is the product of a 6th-order high-pass Butterworth filter at 100 Hz, and a 1st-order low-pass Butterworth filter at 200 Hz. This filter will be used as the baseline SWR detection algorithm in the following chapter.

\section{Online envelope estimation}

Besides requiring causal band-pass filters, the real-time constraint of online SWR detection also means that we can no longer use the Hilbert transform to calculate the envelope $n_t$ of the band-pass filter output $o_t$. In practice, the band-pass filter output is instead often simply rectified (i.e. $n_t = \abs{o_t}$).
% Although the resulting jagged signal is not as visually pleasing as the Hilbert-transform based envelope, it is effective for signal detection.
% (In \citefull{Sethi2014}, it was shown that more advanced online envelope estimators do not yield better detection performance).

Extensions of simple rectification have also been used. In \citefull{Jadhav2012}, the online envelope $n_t$ is an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of $\abs{o_t}$, with a variable gain. (In their EWMA update equation, a slightly higher weight is used for $\abs{o_t}$  whenever $n_t < \abs{o_t}$ -- see \cref{apx:online-detection-algos}). In \citefull{Dutta2018}, $\abs{o_t}$ is smoothed with a 50 Hz low-pass FIR filter.

Both methods add latency. The EWMA method of \citeauthor*{Jadhav2012} delays the envelope by about 2 milliseconds when applied to our recording. The FIR low-pass filter of \citeauthor*{Dutta2018} has a constant group delay of about 5 milliseconds.

Smoothing $\abs{o_t}$ yields a visually more pleasing envelope. This is not a requirement for online SWR detectors however. Smoothing may prevent spurious detections whenever the unsmoothed signal contains outliers (strong peaks in magnitude that do not correspond to a peak in the underlying `real' signal). Our recording (and the band-pass filtered version of it) does not seem to contain such outliers however. Because smoothing adds latency, we do not smooth our online envelopes; all online envelopes in this thesis are calculated as $n_t = \abs{o_t}$.
